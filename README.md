This repository contains my personal notes, exercises, and project solutions from **Angela Yu's "The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp"** on Udemy.

## 📚 Structure & Progress

I’ve structured the repository by course sections, and within each folder, you'll find relevant exercises and solutions.  
Each project or practice file typically includes:

- ✅ A clear description of the exercise  
- ❓ The original question or goal of the task  
- 💡 My solution along with explanations and comments

This format not only helps me reinforce what I’ve learned, but may also benefit others who are following the same course.

> 🚧 **Ongoing Learning:** I am continuously updating this repository as I progress through the course.
